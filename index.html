      <p class="text">The mapping of the data to sound is based on nine sinusoids that correspond to the nine counties of Austria. The base frequency of each sine-tone correlates with the longitude-value of the capital of the county in a way that the longitude values are sorted and then assigned to 9 frequencies derived from the multiplication of a base frequency that the recipients are able to choose. The amplitude of the sound generators is modulated by the daily cases of covid19-infections, where the numbers were scaled to represent a value between 0 and 1, to suit the needs of being a relevant amplitude value. Pitch changes were achieved by mapping the 7-day-incidence according to the aforementioned warning system, established by the Austrian government. The warning system that corresponds to a traffic light was used to make government actions generally comprehensible and relies heavily on the 7-day-incidence-values. The mapping was handled so that with each step further towards the red light, the base frequencies get multiplied by a given number, so that they increase in pitch. This results in a dense, loud and high pitched cluster at times where the pandemic was in its peaks, and lower pitches otherwise. Further parameters will be introduced in future work, via frequency modulation, which allows for enhanced complexity in sound, without losing its commitment to sine waves as being the main sound source. To provide further contextualization, a simple visual aid in the form of an animated plot was provided.</p>
